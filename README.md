1. Install LivelyWallpaper.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. If you chose download zip option on GitHub website, extract the zip file to a place you can remember.
4. In LivelyWallpaper, click "Add wallpaper" (the big "+" button).
5. Open the folder of the zip you just extracted and drag-drop the "index.html" file into the pop-up.

6. Add more information as you wish on the next pop up or simply just click "Ok" to save the wallpaper.
